| Description | The Oera Linda Book is a manuscript that claims that the Frisian people are the source of western civilization, and links them with the old legend of Atlantis. It first showed up in 1872, and although it was relatively quickly recognized as a falsification, the controversy around this book has not yet ended. The open issue is who did it. |
